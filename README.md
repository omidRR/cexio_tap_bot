# cexio_tap_bot

**No need to log in to Telegram account**

+ Auto Tap
+ Auto online
+ Auto farm and auto claim
+ Multi account
+ Proxy Support ( in config.json , When the program is built, the file will be created ) 
+ All requests are saved in the logs.txt

``Please place the account link in the urls.txt file and list the links one below the other for multi-accounting.``

I don't feel like explaining right now, I have completed the program, build and use it yourself

It is better to run on the server And in Linux use tmux or nohup to not close the session
